                                            <p>I am Patricio Miner, a <strong>Software Developer Engineer in Test</strong> from Argentina, living in New Zealand and loving it! After five years of working in the local scene, I've put my expertise and knowledge as a service to deliver the best training and mentorships for local professionals looking to up or re-skill to find <a href="https://www.careers.govt.nz/jobs-database/it-and-telecommunications/information-technology/test-analyst/">better opportunities in a great market.</a></p>
                                            <p>As a professional consultant and coach based in the beautiful city of Wellington, I offer holistic ü§ñ <strong>Automation and Test Engineering</strong> mentoring through workshops, webinars and private classes to groups and anyone, new or seasoned professionals, interested in testing. I have vast experience teaching the most demanded tools in the market and the best practices and processes any good tester should be familiar with.</p>
                                            <p>I've been üßëüèª‚Äçüíª mentoring the Spanish-speaking community for the last five years through courses, webinars, and thousands of students and companies using my training for their teams through Udemy Business have either found their first job in IT or better positions. <strong>Now it is time for our community in New Zealand to shine</strong> and generate the pool of professionals the market demands!</p>
                                            <p>From building automation frameworks from scratch with Selenium and Cucumber to API Automation, E2E Automation with Cypress and Playwright to setting CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions, and I can teach you how to do it üîé</p>
                                            <p><strong>Completely new to Testing?</strong> Don't worry, I can teach you the skills, processes and techniques you need to do an awesome job as a tester! From Black and White Box techniques, to API exploration and analysis of requirements, there is plenty to learn before diving into automation.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Why the name QAllaborative</strong>, you might wonder? Well, I believe that QA should be the collaboration during all the stages of the <strong>Software Development Life Cycle</strong> and everybody's responsibility, something I strongly emphasize during my mentorship and a mindset you will adopt as a student!</p>
