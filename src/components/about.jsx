                    <h2 className="colorlib-heading">Helping you achieve your software quality goals</h2>
                    <p>I am Patricio Miner, a <strong>Senior Software Developer Engineer in Test</strong> from Argentina üá¶üá∑, living in New Zealand üá≥üáø and loving it! After five years of working in the local scene, I've put my expertise and knowledge as a service to deliver the best training and mentorships for local professionals looking to up or re-skill.</p>                  
                    <p>As a professional consultant and coach¬†based in the beautiful city of Wellington, I offer holistic ü§ñ <strong>Automation and Test Engineering</strong> mentoring through workshops, webinars and private classes to anyone, new or seasoned professionals, interested in testing. I have vast experience teaching the most demanded tools in the market and the best practices and processes any good tester should be familiar with.</p>
                    <p>I've been üßëüèª‚Äçüíª mentoring the Spanish-speaking community for the last five years through courses, webinars, and thousands of students and companies using my training for their teams through Udemy Business. <strong>Now it is time for our community in New Zealand to shine</strong> and generate the pool of professionals the market demands (and will continue to increase in demand)</p>
                    <p>From building automation frameworks from scratch with Selenium and Cucumber to API Automation, E2E Automation with Cypress and Playwright to setting the foundations of CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions, and I can teach you how to do it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why the name QAllaborative</strong>, you might wonder? Well,¬†I believe that QA should be the collaboration during all the stages of the SDLC and everybody's responsibility, something I strongly emphasize during my mentorship and a mindset you will adopt as a student!</p>
                    <h2 className="colorlib-heading">Where can you start learning?</h2>
                    <p>Here are a couple of options for you to consider. You can start by arranging a catchup with me to see where you are at with your testing skills (don't be afraid if you are new to testing!). Feel free to schedule a session by using the <strong>Let's have a catchup</strong> button</p>
                    <p>If you want to come and join a group of friendly people talking and learning about testing, feel free to check our <strong>Meetup group</strong> by clicking on the side panel, where you can find the <strong>Meetup icon</strong></p>
                    <p>You may already know what tool you want to learn. <strong>Or you may be in a role that requires you to understand a particular technology</strong>üöÄ. Let's discuss my private classes so you can nail it at your job!</p>
